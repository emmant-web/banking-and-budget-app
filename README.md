# Banking & Budget App

A simple admin-style **banking and budget application** built with **React** and **Material UI**. This project allows users to perform core banking transactions such as **transfers**, **deposits**, and **sending money**. It also includes a **budget tracking** section where users can visualize their **expenses through graphs**.

This was our **first project using React**, and it helped us learn key concepts of frontend development and working with UI component libraries like Material UI.
